## <a name="purpose">⚙️ Purpose</a>

The project is designed to enhance understanding of Process Scheduling Algorithms by providing a visual representation along with the required calculations. The logic for the algorithms is implemented in JavaScript.

## <a name="usage">🔋 Usage</a>

To use the simulator, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. The default scheduling method is Round Robin (RR).
3. You can select other scheduling methods from the dropdown menu.
4. For RR, enter a natural number in the Time Quantum field.
5. To add a process, click on "Add Process".
6. After adding the processes, click on "Run Algorithm".
7. The Gantt Chart, Ready Queue (for RR and SRTF), Process Description Table, and Average Calculations will be displayed.

## <a name="features">🛠️ Features</a>

- **Round Robin (RR)**: Requires a time quantum input.
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: Executes processes based on shortest execution time.
- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**: Executes processes in the order they arrive.
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**: Similar to SJF but preemptive.

## <a name="getting-started">🚀 Getting Started</a>

1. **Open the HTML file**: Launch the simulator by opening the HTML file in your browser.
2. **Select Algorithm**: Choose the desired scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. **Input Time Quantum for RR**: If using RR, input a natural number for the time quantum.
4. **Add Processes**: Click "Add Process" to input process details.
5. **Run Algorithm**: Click "Run Algorithm" to see the visualizations.

## <a name="visualizations">📊 Visualizations</a>

- **Gantt Chart**: Displays the order of process execution.
- **Ready Queue**: Shows the queue of processes waiting to be executed (for RR and SRTF).
- **Process Description Table**: Lists process details and metrics.
- **Average Calculations**: Provides average waiting and turnaround times.

By using this simulator, you can gain a better understanding of how different Process Scheduling Algorithms work and visualize their effects on process management.
